    <h1>02.Importance of meta tag and Doctypes</h1>
    <p>
        <strong> Meta Tag :- </strong> Meta tags are an important part of a solid SEO strategy. Meta
      tags are important because they impact how your site appears in the SERPs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Doctypes :- </strong> Doctypes is most often written at the very first element of
      the entire HTML document. It remains wrapped inside angle brackets but it
      is not a tag. It is a statement or declaration. Doctype stands for
      Document Type.
