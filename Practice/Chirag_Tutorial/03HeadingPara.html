        <strong>Headings</strong>
        <p>
          Paragraphs and headings work in concert to create the majority of the
          text content of a web page and its structure.HTML has six heading
          elements, which are numbered 1 through 6.h1 is the most significant
          and usually contains the title of the content â€“ Not to be confused
          with the title that appears in the browser tab.h2 represents a
          subsection. h3 and so on represent identifiers of further subjects in
          subsections until we get to h6.
