    <h1>Why use HTML?</h1>
    <p>
      HTML is the skeleton of just about any website. It provides the bones that
      underpin everything else on site.Common things that HTML is used to define
      are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Paragraphs</strong>
        <p>
          The HTML paragraph element is one of the most common elements and as
          you might have guessed it defines a paragraph.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Line Breaks</strong>
        <p>
          As with print media, a paragraph creates a line break below it to
          visually separate it from other paragraphs. This is used to emphasise
          a semantic separation of content. The same structure is used in a
          novel or a magazine.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Block Elements</strong>
        <p>
          Elements that create the spacing below themselves on a page are called
          block elements.Block elements appear vertically down the left-hand
          side of a page at least until they are styled by CSS.Examples of block
          elements are < div > , < article > , < table > and many more.This
          feature allows HTML to start separating a webpage into different
          sections.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Headings</strong>
        <p>
          Paragraphs and headings work in concert to create the majority of the
          text content of a web page and its structure.HTML has six heading
          elements, which are numbered 1 through 6.h1 is the most significant
          and usually contains the title of the content â€“ Not to be confused
          with the title that appears in the browser tab.h2 represents a
          subsection. h3 and so on represent identifiers of further subjects in
          subsections until we get to h6.
